# Medicinal-Marijuana-Sales-Forecasting
The goal of this project is to forecast California's medical marijuana sales for the next 12 months.

* Imported California's monthly medical marijuana sales data from January 2014 to November 2020.
* Adjusted sales for inflation using Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers.
* Visualized the data by creating time, seasonal, and autocorrelation plots.
* Created four preliminary models - mean, naive (random walk), random walk with drift, and seasonal naive 
* Next Steps - exlore decomposition, stationarity
* Next Next Steps - forecast using exponential smoothing (ETS), ARIMA, and Seasonal ARIMA models
